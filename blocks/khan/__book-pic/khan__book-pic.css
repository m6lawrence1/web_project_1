/*I don't think we went over object-fit or object-position in the lessons*/
}

/*
Fixed height and width. Swithched padding to margin - note to self, margins should be used between elements. Paddings are inside element. Thanks!

Added overflow hidden and height to khan__book-container instead of using object-fit and object-postion just to stick to what we have learned so far.
